# Biography

Welcome to my homepage. I'm currently an associate professor at Shanghai University. I received my B.E., Ph.D. and postdoc degrees from the [EE](www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn) department at Tsinghua University, China in 2015 and 2010, respectively. My advisor was Prof. [Zhisheng Niu](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/ee/4157/2010/20101217200902455328237/20101217200902455328237_.html) from [Niulab](http://network.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/niulab), [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I visited the [WiDeS](http://wides.usc.edu/welcome/) group at University of Southern California from September 2013 to April 2014, advised by Prof. [A. F. Molisch](http://wides.usc.edu/people/molisch/) and Prof. [Giuseppe Caire](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Caire/Giuseppe). I then worked as an experienced researcher at [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/) from 2015 to 2016. I visited [ARNG](https://anrg.usc.edu/www/) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), Los Angeles, USA, working with Prof. [Bhaskar Krishnamachari](http://ceng.usc.edu/~bkrishna/) from 2017 to 2018.
